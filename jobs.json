        "About UsWe're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us.

We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays).About The RoleRemember the first time you solved a problem by programming? The delight and excitement you felt when it finally...worked?

If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.Familiarity with the backend: You understand how parts of a system fit together\u2014from the user interface to the data model. Experienced candidates should be familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL.Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about the business impact of what you're building, and you prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff\u2014you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact\u2014good and bad.Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.Team player: You understand when work is better, together.

        "About us:Nomic was founded with the purpose of making biology easier to measure. To do this, we have untangled some of the most difficult problems in protein profiling. Our team is combining DNA nanotechnology, high-dimensional flow cytometry, laboratory automation, and machine learning to develop the world\u2019s highest throughput proteomic platform: the nELISA.Since spinning out of McGill University, we have partnered with and provided platform access to dozens of drug discovery groups including GSK, 4 of the top 10 pharmas, and leading biotechs. We have recently launched a state of the art manufacturing and protein profiling facility that enables multiplexed measurement of >2.5M samples a year, generating an effective 500M protein assays in the process.We are building a diverse team of engineers, scientists, and world-changers. We like to break down difficult problems using a first principles approach, often leveraging the latest breakthroughs from across the scientific and technological spectrum to drive our mission forward.Nomic is headquartered in Montreal, Canada with a satellite research lab in Boston, Massachusetts. The majority of our team is based in Montreal and works in a new, shared office/laboratory space with an in-person, but flexible work-from-home, policy.About the role:Our Software team\u2019s mission is to design, build, and support world class software that empowers all nELISA users with proteomics superpowers, including internal at Nomic. Software is integral to our vision of the future, and every aspect of our company today will depend on improving our software stack. Functionally, our software stack includes (i) an in-house developed full-stack LIMS that underpins inventory, manufacturing, lab operations, and that will continue to drive further lab automation going forward; (ii) data pipelines and associated cloud data infrastructure to monitor, decode, and quantitatively analyze flow cytometry nELISA experiments; and (iii) a customer-facing web portal that enables nELISA users to visualize and analyze their proteomic datasets at scale seamlessly in the browser.As a Software Engineer, you will be responsible for building all core components of the nELISA software stack, and scaling them as needed, often as a member of cross-functional projects working closely with our broader Engineering, Commercial, and Lab Operations teams. You will also get to build internal tools that create and support data-driven feedback loops for our teammates in R&D, automation, manufacturing, customer success, and bioinformatics. In short, you will get to make substantive changes and build the core components of the software stack that underpins the nELISA\u2019s technological flywheel.You will therefore get to play a critical, first-hand role in developing core improvements to the LIMS, web portal, and data infrastructure for handling all things nELISA data. In particular, you will:Write sub-components of our software stack from scratch, such as database schemas, analysis pipelines and new analysis algorithms, cloud infrastructure and related IaC, full stack web interfaces, machine learning models, and APIs that will be consumed both by our own services, and by customers. Develop improved internal tools for our LIMS, and software for our R&D teams, in order to increase operations and R&D velocity in the lab, including developing and implementing an electronic lab notebooks (ELN) plan tailor fit to our profiling and manufacturing lab operations.
